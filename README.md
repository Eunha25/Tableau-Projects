## Project Overview
The goal of these projects is to analyze and visualize data collected from different data sources. The collected data will be transformed into meaningful insights and presented in an interactive and visually appealing manner using Tableau.

## Data Preparation
Before visualizing the data in Tableau, it is important to ensure the data is properly prepared and formatted. The following steps were taken to prepare the data for visualization:

1. Data Cleaning: The collected data were reviewed for any inconsistencies or errors and cleaned accordingly.
2. Data Transformation: If necessary, certain data fields were transformed or modified to facilitate analysis and visualization.


## Tableau Visualization

1. Connect to Data: Tableau was connected to the prepared dataset 
2. Data Modeling: The data model was created, defining relationships between the different data fields.
3. Visualization Creation: Various visualizations were created using Tableau's intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Common visualizations include bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, maps, and tables.
4. Interaction and Filters: Interactivity features were implemented to allow users to explore the data and filter visualizations based on different criteria.
5. Dashboard Creation: Visualizations were organized into a dashboard layout, enabling users to view multiple visualizations simultaneously and gain a comprehensive understanding of the data.
6. Report Publishing: The finalized Tableau report was published to a desired platform for sharing with stakeholders.
